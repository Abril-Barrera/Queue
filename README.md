# Queue
Implementation of a queue (linked list) using C++ core guidelines. 

I selected the following attributes for my queue: 

	int *arr;		// array to store queue elements
	int capacity;	// maximum capacity of the queue
	int front;		// front points to front element in the queue (if any)
	int rear;		// rear points to last element in the queue
	int count;		// current size of the queue

And I propose the following functions:

	void dequeue();
	void enqueue(int x);
	int peek();
	int size();
	bool isEmpty();
	bool isFull();
  
  If you want to collaborate, let me know which part you want to implement.
